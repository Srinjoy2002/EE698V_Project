\section{Summary of Research Papers}
In this section, you will dedicate a subsection to each paper. The goal is to summarize each one accurately and concisely.


\subsection{The limits of Classical Controlability}
The classical notion of controllability mainly dwells in a binary approach: a network is either controllable or not! This approach however, is often based on structural controllability, which is trivial for determining the minimum number of control nodes to ensure control is theoretically as well as practically possible. A network may be controllable on paper but require physically unrealizable amounts of energy, making it "practically uncontrollable". The goal of this research was to establish a formal link between the network's graphical topology and this control energy cost.
\subsubsection{Control Energy Shift}
They modeled the network as a discrete-time Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) system :
\begin{equation}
    x(t+1) = Ax(t) + B_{\mathcal{K}}u_{\mathcal{K}}(t)
    \label{eq:lti}
\end{equation}
Where $x(t) \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is the state vector, $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is the network's adjacency matrix, and $B_{\mathcal{K}}$ is an input matrix selecting $m$ control nodes from the set $\mathcal{K}$ . The energy needed for control is fundamentally linked to the Controllability Gramian, defined as :
\begin{equation}
    W_{\mathcal{K},T} = \sum_{\tau=0}^{T-1}A^{\tau}B_{\mathcal{K}}B_{\mathcal{K}}^{\top}(A^{\top})^{\tau}
    \label{eq:gramian}
\end{equation}
To quantify control difficulty, we analyze the worst-case energy required to steer the system. This is given by the inverse of the smallest eigenvalue of the Gramian, $\lambda_{\min}(W_{\mathcal{K},T})$. A system is considered difficult to control if $\lambda_{\min}(W_{\mathcal{K},T})$ is very small.
\subsubsection{Assumptions and analysis}
The analysis relies on the spectral properties of the network matrix $A$.

\paragraph{Assumption 1:} \label{sec:assumpt1} The network matrix $A$ is irreducible and marginally stable. This guarantees a unique, real principal eigenvalue $\lambda_1 = \rho(A)$ such that $1 \ge \lambda_1 \ge |\lambda_i|$ for all other eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ of $A$.

This assumption ensures the existence of strictly positive right ($v$) and left ($w$) leading eigenvectors corresponding to $\lambda_1$ {1983}:
\begin{equation}
    Av = \lambda_1 v, \quad A^{\top}w = \lambda_1 w
    \label{eq:eigenvectors}
\end{equation}
From these, we construct a related symmetric, positive semi-definite matrix $A_S$ as follows:
\begin{equation}
    \pi= [\frac{w_1}{v_1}\frac{w_2}{v_2} ...\frac{w_n}{v_n}]^{\top}
\end{equation}
The diagonal matrix: \\
\begin{equation}
\Pi:= \text{diag}(\pi) \\
,A_R:= \Pi^{-1}A^{\top}\Pi \quad  \\
\end{equation}
The matrix $A_R$  is irreducible and $v,w$ are its leading eigen vectors with respect to $\lambda_1$.
\begin{equation}
A_S:= \Pi^{1/2} A A_R \Pi^{-1/2}
\end{equation}
Let the eigenvalues of $A_S$ be sorted as $\sigma_1 \ge \sigma_2 \ge \dots \ge \sigma_n \ge 0$. The largest eigenvalue is $\sigma_1 = \lambda_1^2$.
\subsection{Results}

\subsubsection{A Structural Bound on Control Energy}
The main result from provides a direct link between the network's structural properties (encoded in its eigenspace) and its energetic controllability.

\paragraph{Theorem 1:} Let $A$ be a non-negative matrix satisfying Assumption 1, as in section \ref{sec:assumpt1}, and assume the product $AA^{\top}$ is primitive. The minimum eigenvalue of the controllability Gramian for any set $\mathcal{K}$ of $m$ control nodes is bounded by:
% \begin{equation}
%     % \lambda_{\min}(W_{\mathcal{K},T}) \le \frac{\max_{i}\{w_{i}/v_{i}\}}{\min_{i}\{w_{i}/v_{i}\}}\frac{\sigma_{2}^{\frac{n}{m}-2}}{1-\sigma_{2}}
%     % \label{eq:main_bound}
%     \lambda_{\min}(W_{\mathcal{K},T}) \le \frac{\max_{i}\{w_{i}/v_{i}\}}{\min_{i}\{w_{i}/v_{i}\}}\frac{\sigma_{2}^{\frac{n}{m}}{\sigma_2^2(1-\sigma_2)}
% \end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \lambda_{\min}(W_{\mathcal{K},T}) 
    \le 
    \underbrace{
        \frac{\max_{i}\left\{\frac{w_{i}}{v_{i}}\right\}}{\min_{i}\left\{\frac{w_{i}}{v_{i}}\right\}}
    }_{\text{anisotropy ratio}}
    \cdot
    \underbrace{
        \frac{\sigma_{2}^{\frac{n}{m} }}{\sigma_2^2(1 - \sigma_{2})}
    }_{\text{spectral properties}}
    \label{eq:main_bound}
\end{equation}


This bound shows that control difficulty depends on the anisotropy ratio (the first term, measuring structural imbalance) and the spectral properties of the network (the second term, related to the mixing rate).
\subsubsection{Case of Reversible Matrices}
The interpretation becomes even more concrete for the subclass of **reversible** stochastic matrices. A stochastic matrix is reversible if it satisfies $A=A^R$, where $A^R$ is the time-reversal matrix defined in Equation \ref{eq:ar}. This class includes the transition matrices of random walks on undirected graphs \cite{552}.

For a random walk on an undirected graph with a symmetric adjacency matrix $C$, the transition matrix is $A=CD^{-1}$. In this case, the eigenvector centrality $v_i$ is directly proportional to the weighted degree of the node \cite{580-581}:
\begin{equation}
    v_i = \frac{C_{i}^{\text{col}}}{C_{\text{tot}}} = \frac{\sum_{j}C_{ji}}{\sum_{i,j}C_{ij}}
\end{equation}
This establishes a direct link between the abstract eigenvector centrality and the simple, intuitive graph property of node degree. Consequently, the heterogeneity index simplifies to the ratio of the maximum to minimum degree \cite{582-583}:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{v_{\max}}{v_{\min}} = \frac{\max_{i}\{C_{i}^{\text{col}}\}}{\min_{i}\{C_{i}^{\text{col}}\}}
\end{equation}
\subsubsection*{The Perron-Frobenius Theorem and Its Link to the Paper}
The Perron-Frobenius theorem applies to any non-negative, \textbf{irreducible} matrix $A$ (which represents a strongly connected graph). It guarantees:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A unique, real, and positive eigenvalue $\lambda_1$ that is equal to the spectral radius of the matrix, $\lambda_1 = \rho(A)$.
    \item Corresponding left ($w$) and right ($v$) eigenvectors that are \textbf{strictly positive}, meaning all their components are positive.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Its Crucial Role in the Paper}

The paper's analysis is entirely dependent on these guarantees:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{It Establishes Centrality Vectors}: The theorem ensures that the vectors $v$ and $w$---which the paper interprets as \textbf{eigenvector centrality}---exist, are unique (up to scaling), and are positive for any connected network.Without this, the core concept of a heterogeneity index ($\frac{v_{\max}}{v_{\min}}$) would be ill-defined.

    \item \textbf{It Enables the Entire Framework}: All subsequent mathematical objects in the paper, including the anisotropy ratio, the time-reversal matrix $A^R$, and the symmetric matrix $A_S$, are constructed directly from these guaranteed positive eigenvectors $v$ and $w$.
\end{itemize}

In essence, the Perron-Frobenius theorem provides the necessary starting point, allowing the authors to confidently extract well-defined centrality vectors from the network's structure, which is the first and most critical step in their entire analysis of control energy.
\subsection{From $\sigma_2$ to the Controllability Metric ($\lambda_{\min}(W)$)}
This final step connects the structural parameter $\sigma_2$ to the ultimate measure of control difficulty using the paper's main theorem \ref{eq:main_bound}.
We begin with the paper's Theorem 1 \ref{eq:main_bound}, which states that the controllability metric is constrained by an upper bound involving $\sigma_2$. For the case of an undirected graph (where the anisotropy ratio becomes the heterogeneity index), the bound is:
\begin{equation}
    \lambda_{\min}(W_{\mathcal{K},T}) \le \frac{v_{\max}}{v_{\min}}\frac{\sigma_{2}^{\frac{n}{m}-2}}{1-\sigma_{2}}
\end{equation}
\paragraph{Substituting the Expression for $\sigma_2$}
for a reversible matrix (like a random walk on an undirected graph), $\sigma_2$ is determined by the eigenvalues of the transition matrix $A$:
\begin{equation}
    \sigma_2 = \max\{\lambda_2(A)^2, \lambda_n(A)^2\}
\end{equation}
Also we have the crucial link to the algebraic connectivity:
\begin{equation}
    \lambda_2(A) = 1 - \mu_2(L_{norm})
\end{equation}
We can now substitute these relationships directly into the main theorem's inequality Eq.(\ref{eq:main_bound}). This gives us a single, comprehensive expression that explicitly links the algebraic connectivity of the graph Laplacian to the controllability bound:
\begin{equation}
    \lambda_{\min}(W) \le \frac{v_{\max}}{v_{\min}} \frac{ \left( \max\{(1-\mu_2(L_{norm}))^2, \lambda_n(A)^2\} \right)^{\frac{n}{m}-2} }{ 1 - \max\{(1-\mu_2(L_{norm}))^2, \lambda_n(A)^2\} }
\end{equation}
\paragraph{Mathematical Interpretation}
This expression, while complex, formally demonstrates the complete mathematical chain and allows us to analyze the relationship:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A high algebraic connectivity (a large $\mu_2(L_{norm})$) makes the term $(1-\mu_2(L_{norm}))$ smaller.
    \item This, in turn, leads to a small $\sigma_2$, as long as the smallest eigenvalue $\lambda_n(A)$ is not close to $-1$.
    \item A small $\sigma_2$ has two beneficial effects on the bound:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item It makes the denominator $1-\sigma_2$ large.
        \item It makes the numerator, which contains $\sigma_2$ raised to a positive power (for $n>2m$), small.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
Both of these effects push the upper bound on $\lambda_{\min}(W)$ higher. A higher bound means the system is permitted to have better controllability.

\vspace{1em}
\noindent Therefore, the structural cohesion of the graph, as measured by the algebraic connectivity ($\mu_2(L_{norm})$), propagates through the spectral properties of the system's transition matrix to place a hard, quantifiable limit on its energetic controllability ($\lambda_{\min}(W)$).
\paragraph{Inference from the Simulation Result}
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{sim.png}
    \caption{Upperbound and cohesion relation}
    \label{fig:sim_result}
\end{figure}
The simulation plot Figure:  visually confirms  this relationship, but adds a crucial nuance:
The E-R (Isotropic) graphs (blue circles) have high algebraic connectivity but a very low controllability bound. Their structural uniformity makes them difficult to control. The B-A (Anisotropic) graphs (red triangles) have a much higher controllability bound, even with lower algebraic connectivity. Their structural heterogeneity is the dominant factor.
The key takeaway is that while structural cohesion is important, the diversity of node influence (anisotropy) is the more critical factor for achieving energy-efficient control in complex networks.
\section{Resolving the Dilemma with Non-Normality}
The choice of driver nodes presents a dilemma: maximizing average efficiency ($Tr(W)$) favors influential hubs, while minimizing worst-case energy ($\lambda_{\min}(W)$) favors hard-to-reach nodes . This conflict is resolved by analyzing the network's non-normality.
A matrix is normal if it commutes with its transpose, $[A, A^\top] = 0$ . The paper proves that a network is a balanced realization (where controllability and observability are balanced) if and only if $A$ is normal. Non-normality can be quantified at the node level by defining two novel centralities based on "walk energy" $\epsilon_{i \to j}$:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Node-to-Network ($p_i$)}: Measures influence.
    \begin{equation}
        p_i = \sum_{j=1}^{n} \epsilon_{i \to j} = Tr(W^{(i)}) \quad 
    \end{equation}
    \item \textbf{Network-to-Node ($q_j$)}: Measures reachability.
    \begin{equation}
        q_j = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \epsilon_{i \to j} = Tr(M^{(j)}) \quad 
    \end{equation}
\end{itemize}
Node-level non-normality is then the imbalance between these two:
\begin{equation}
    r_{\text{diff},i} = p_i - q_i \quad 
\end{equation}

    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The results in Table \ref{tab:performance_case_study} are stark. The naive strategy of maximizing influence ($\mathcal{K}_{Tr}=\{2,4\}$) fails catastrophically, rendering the system uncontrollable ($\lambda_{\min}=0$) because it neglects the root node (Node 1) {2123-2124]. The non-normality strategies succeed by selecting nodes with high imbalance (like Node 1), ensuring controllability and providing a robust trade-off between average and worst-case energy.

\section{Conclusion}
The research presented provides a powerful narrative, moving from the abstract spectral properties of a network's adjacency matrix to a practical, effective strategy for control. The key insight is that the structural heterogeneity of a network, quantifiable via centrality measures, directly governs the energy required for its control. The concept of non-normality provides a unifying principle that resolves the conflict between competing energy metrics, leading to robust driver node selection strategies. This work elegantly demonstrates how deep concepts from graph theory are essential for solving complex problems in the engineering of networked systems.

\section{Introduction: The Limits of Pairwise Centrality}
The classical measure of a node's influence as a communication broker is its vertex betweenness centrality (v-BC) \cite{1359-1360}:
\begin{equation}
    B(v_i) = \sum_{s \neq v_i \neq t} \frac{\sigma_{st}(v_i)}{\sigma_{st}}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_{st}$ is the number of shortest paths between nodes $s$ and $t$. This definition, however, is fundamentally node-centric. In many real-world social networks, the primary unit of interaction is not an individual, but a team.

A standard graph model $G=(\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E})$ with $\mathcal{E} \subseteq [\mathcal{V}]^2$ fails to capture this. A single team collaboration (a hyperedge $h \subseteq \mathcal{V}$) and a set of all pairwise interactions between its members (the edge set of a clique, $[h]^2$) are indistinguishable, as both project to a $K_{|h|}$ subgraph. This representational ambiguity necessitates a more expressive framework.

\section{Methodology: Hyperedge Betweenness Centrality (h-BC)}

\subsection{Hypergraph Representation}
To accurately model group interactions, the network is represented as a hypergraph $\mathcal{H} = (\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E})$, where $\mathcal{V}$ is the set of individuals and $\mathcal{E}$ is a multiset of hyperedges, each representing a team \cite{1362}.

\subsection{Bipartite Graph Projection}
The core analytical tool is the projection of the hypergraph onto a bipartite graph $\mathcal{G}_B = (\mathcal{V} \cup \mathcal{E}, E_B)$. The two partitions of the vertex set are the individuals ($\mathcal{V}$) and the teams-as-nodes ($\mathcal{E}$). The edge set is formally defined as:
\begin{equation}
    E_B = \{ \{v, e\} \mid v \in \mathcal{V}, e \in \mathcal{E}, \text{ and } v \in e \}
\end{equation}
This structure provides a tractable model for applying pathfinding algorithms.

\subsection{Weighted Shortest Paths}
A path between two individuals $s,t \in \mathcal{V}$ is an alternating sequence of nodes from $\mathcal{V}$ and $\mathcal{E}$ in $\mathcal{G}_B$. In an unweighted model, the sheer number of such paths dilutes centrality scores, masking the influence hierarchy. To resolve this, a cost $c_i$ is assigned to each hyperedge $e_i$. The paper explores two performance metrics for weighting:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Team Performance ($u_i$):} An empirical value, e.g., the number of articles a team published.
    \item \textbf{Performance per Member ($w_i$):} A normalized value, $w_i = u_i / |e_i|$.
\end{itemize}
The cost is the inverse of a performance metric, e.g., $c_i = 1/u_i$. A shortest path is one that minimizes the total cost, $L(P_{st}) = \sum_{e_i \in P_{st}} c_i$ \cite{1785}.

\subsection{Formal Definition of h-BC}
The Hyperedge Betweenness Centrality (h-BC) of a team $e$ is its betweenness centrality score within the weighted bipartite graph $\mathcal{G}_B$:
\begin{equation}
    B_H(e) = \sum_{s,t \in \mathcal{V}, s \neq t} \frac{\sigma_{st}(e)}{\sigma_{st}}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_{st}$ is the number of shortest-cost paths. This weighted definition restores a heterogeneous, power-law distribution of centrality, providing a meaningful measure of team influence .

Why Betweenness Centrality Matters More Than Degree Centrality Here
First, it's important to clarify that your model is a co-authorship network, where authors are nodes and papers are hyperedges. This is different from a basic citation network, where nodes are papers.

In your co-authorship model, betweenness centrality and degree centrality measure fundamentally different things and answer different questions.

1. What Each Metric Measures in Your Example
Hyperdegree Centrality (Degree Centrality)
This measures the number of collaborations an individual author is involved in. It is a local measure of an author's activity or collaborative breadth. In your example:

Node 2 is the most degree-central author with a hyperdegree of 3.

This tells us that Author 2 is the most active collaborator.

Hyperedge Betweenness Centrality (h-BC)
This measures how often a team (i.e., a paper) lies on the most efficient paths for information to flow between all pairs of authors in the network. It is a global measure of a collaboration's importance as a bridge.

In your example, the team $h_2=1,4,5$ is the most central.

2. Why Not Just Use Degree Centrality?
Knowing that Author 2 is the most active collaborator (highest degree) is useful, but it doesn't tell us which of their projects was the most impactful for the network's cohesion.

It can't distinguish team importance: Does Author 2's presence make team $h_0, h_1, or h_4$ the most important bridge? Degree centrality alone cannot answer this. It assigns importance to the person, not the project.

It's a poor proxy for bridge-like roles: A high-degree node might connect many people who are already well-connected to each other. This makes the node an active hub, but not necessarily a critical bridge between otherwise disconnected communities.

3. Why Betweenness Centrality is the Right Tool for This Question
Science and collaboration are not just about individual activity; they are about the synthesis and transfer of ideas between different groups. Betweenness centrality is the only measure that directly quantifies this role.

In your specific example, betweenness centrality correctly identified that the collaboration $h_2=1,4,5$ is the most influential. Why?

Because it serves as an essential intellectual bridge. Author 1 is from the orbit of team $h_0$, Author 4 is from team $h_1$, and Author 5 is from team $h_3$.

The project $h_2$ is the one and only place where these three distinct research clusters are directly and efficiently linked.

Degree centrality would have missed this completely. It would have pointed to Author 2, but it wouldn't have revealed that the specific project $h_2$ was the most critical event for the overall cohesion and information flow of the entire research community.
% \section{Conclusion}
% The hypergraph betweenness centrality provides a necessary and powerful extension to classical network theory. By accurately modeling group interactions and employing a weighted pathfinding approach, it successfully quantifies the influence of teams as single, cohesive entities. The framework reveals that team influence is a nuanced property, emerging from an interplay between the team's performance, its structural position as a bridge, and the connectivity of its individual members. This methodology offers a more realistic tool for analyzing a wide range of social, biological, and technological systems where collaboration is key.
